# BI BanVic â€“ Performance Indicators

This project demonstrates a Business Intelligence (BI) solution applied to performance analysis for BanVic. By integrating internal data (e.g., agencies, customers, collaborators, accounts, credit proposals, and transactions) with external macroeconomic indicators (IPCA, SELIC, ICC), the project generates strategic insights to support operational and business decision-making.

## Methodology

The project workflow is divided into four main stages:

1. **Data Treatment and Transformation:**
   - Reading and standardizing raw data files.
   - Applying functions to format postal codes, calculate age, and extract year/month from dates.
   - Generating processed files for further analysis.

2. **Removal of Inconsistencies:**
   - Validating records based on predefined rules.
   - Separating consistent data from records with inconsistencies to ensure a reliable database.

3. **Exploratory Analysis and Indicator Generation:**
   - Creating charts and indicators to monitor the evolution of transactions, credit proposals, accounts, and customer/collaborator profiles.
   - Integrating internal data with macroeconomic indicators for a comprehensive analysis.

4. **Interactive Dashboard:**
   - Developing a Power BI dashboard to provide dynamic visualization of key performance indicators.
